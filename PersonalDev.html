    <h1>"What Are My Strengths?"</h1>
    <p>
      <font face="Lato" size="5">
        <ol>
          <li>Work Ethics</li>
          <font face="Lato" size="4">
            <p>One of my strengths is my strong work ethic. When I commit to a deadline, I do whatever it takes to
              deliver. For example, last week I had to cover for my Manager at work and complete reports on her behalf
              all while completing a training class. I had to multi-task to accomplish same and was successful in
              completing the task at hand as I knew the client <b>HAD</b> to receive the report on time.</p>
          </font>
          <li>Organizational Skills</li>
          <font face="Lato" size="4">
            <p>First of all, I’m highly organized and very good at keeping myself up to date and a department running
              and I actually enjoy the detail work of scheduling, prioritizing, organizing, and following up.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, I’m also a Creative person. I think that really comes in handy in any field,
              especially an innovative company. I’m known for coming up with creative solutions to problems and I’m very
              Team-oriented. I love collaborating with other people, especially creative people. I’m also known for
              being the kind of person you can always count on in a pinch.</p>
          </font>
          <li>Writing/Communication Skills</li>
          <font face="Lato" size="4">
            <p>I am proud of my writing skills and believe I am able to communicate complicated topics to different
              audiences. I can take a lot of data and information and find the story and themes that clients need to
              know about.</p>
          </font>
        </ol>
      </font>
      <font face="Lato" size="4">
        <p>By no means do I consider myself to have "arrived," but I am surprised by how far I've been willing to jorney
          in the last three to five years as I have leveraged by introversion to lead in a way that's natural for me.

    <h1>Twelve Pillars; <i>Goals #4 - 8</i></h1>
    <font face="Lato" size="4">
      <h3>Goal 4: Achieve Your Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <font face="Lato" size="4">
            <p>
              <i>"The major reason for setting a goal is for what it makes of you to accomplish it."</i>
            </p>
            <p>
              The setting of goals has been shown to increase motivation and organizational commitment. By identifying and putting my goals on paper, I would have fully made myself aware of what they are and thus unconsciously my mind would start working towards it without me realizing it. So putting my goals on paper would be the first step, consequently, I would start breaking down my goals into different categories. That is, stepping stone goals, short term goals, long term goals and finally lifetime goals.
            </p>
          </font>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Goal 5: The Proper Use of Time </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <font face="Lato" size="4">
            <p>
              <i>"Everyday has many opportunities, but only one best opportunity."</i>
            </p>
            <p>
              We all must suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. I need to start speding time on what is important to me, that is, the best opportunity for me each day that aligns with my overall goals. The laid back, non-chalant behaviour of just going through the day with no real aim in mind is of bad habit and I look forward to taking the best course of action in life for me.
            </p>
          </font>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Goal 6: Surround Yourself With the Best People</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <font face="Lato" size="4">
            <p>
              <i>"Don’t join an easy crowd; you wont grow. Go where the expectations and the demands to perform are high."</i>
            </p>
            <p>
              After asking myself these questions:  Who am I around?  What effect are they having on me? What have they got me reading? What have they got me saying? Where do they have me going? What do they have me thinking? And most importantly, what do they have me becoming? is that okay?
            </p>
            <p>
              These are questions I have already asked myself on my personal development journey. I've already identified that the persons you surround yourself with, have a major impact on my life. I have since then surrounded myself with successful people and have noticed overtime, my reason and perspective on life and how to live has drastically changed for the best.
            </p>
          </font>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Goal 7: Be a Life-Long Learner </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <font face="Lato" size="4">
            <p>
              <i>"Formal education will make you a living.  Self education will make you a fortune."</i>
            </p>
            <p>
              Self-education is a very powerful tool. Since surrounding myself with successful people and a similar mindset for the hunger of growth, I have found myself constantly improving and growing. I learnt to seperate myself from others and be focused on continuous learning. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I have read some very motivating books that has taught me the basics on how to make money work for me from popular authors, <a href="https://www.richdad.com/" target="_blank">Robert Kiyosaki</a>, an American businessman. He has written one of the best books I have ever read, which offered personal finance education to help myself learn about cash flow, real estate, investing and business build. This knowledge has certainly been a great asset.
            </p>
          </font>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Goal 8: All of Life is Sales </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <font face="Lato" size="4">
            <p>
              <i>"One key to having influence with others is to have others perceive you as a person of talent and virtue."</i>
            </p>
            <p>
              Having the influence and the ability of selling myself in a successful manner is definitely one area where I can definitely say there are several areas of opportunity. However, being apart of the network I am now, I can definitely attain the right mindset and skillset of reaching my personal goals I have laid out for myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              In other words and an example, becoming a millionaire is not the most important thing, but what I become indirectly as I now have the knowledge and skills to earn it again if I was to lose said million.
